# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer.

This code of conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0.

## Wider Community Core Values
As a Go project, we also ask that our community members honour and familiarise themselves with the 
[Go Community Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct).
